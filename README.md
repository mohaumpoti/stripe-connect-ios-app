This application is used to demonstrate authentication to a Stripe Account. On
successful authentication, a Stripe User ID (Stripe Account ID) will be returned to the user. It is meant to work in conjunction with a [Node.js App] as the backend.

You will need to configure the [Node.js App] first in order to obtain your hosted 'url'. Once the url is available, you should then assign it to the instance variable 'url', in StripeConnectViewController.swift as shown below;
